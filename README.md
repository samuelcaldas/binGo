# binGo

binGo is a free, open-source Flask application designed to enhance your programming experience by leveraging the power of GPT as a coding assistant. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with GPT, which acts as a virtual copilot, guiding you through code-related queries and aiding in the development process.

## Features

- **GPT Integration**: Utilize the advanced capabilities of GPT to get coding assistance, explanations, and suggestions directly within the app.
- **Code Assistance**: Whether you're debugging or looking for code optimization, binGo's integration with GPT can provide valuable insights.
- **Enhanced Productivity**: Streamline your coding workflow with an AI companion that understands your programming needs.
- **Natural Language Queries**: Simply describe what you need in plain English, and binGo will provide the relevant code snippets.
- **Learning Tool**: Use binGo as a learning aid to understand new libraries or frameworks.

## Installation

To install binGo, ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher and Flask 2.0 or higher. Install Flask using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

Clone this repository or download the `app.py` file to your computer.

## Usage

To use binGo, run the `run_binGo.cmd` file in the app folder:

```bash
.\run_binGo.cmd
```

This starts a local server on port 80. Open Microsoft Edge browser and navigate to:

```text
http://localhost/<path:folder>
```

Replace `<path:folder>` with the path of the folder you want to browse. For example, if you want to browse the folder C:\Users\UserName\source\repos\binGo, you can go to:

```text
http://localhost/C:/Users/UserName/source/repos/binGo
```


Enjoy a free and more productive coding session with binGo and GPT-powered AI assistance!
